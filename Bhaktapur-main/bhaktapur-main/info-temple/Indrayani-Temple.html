    <p>The Indrayani Temple in Kathmandu is believed to have been established in the 13th century by King Gunakamdev, who is also credited with founding the city itself. It is one of the eight Matrikas (mother goddesses) established in the shape of Khadga (a type of sword) by the king. The temple is also known as Luti Ajima among the Newar community. </p>
