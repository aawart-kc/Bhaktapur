    <p>Sāpāru, locally known as Gai Jatra, is a deeply meaningful and colorful festival celebrated in Bhaktapur to honor family members who have passed away in the previous year. Rooted in Newar tradition, the festival combines remembrance with cultural expression, where families participate in processions by dressing children as cows—considered sacred and symbolic guides to the afterlife—or as deities and mythical figures. The streets of Bhaktapur come alive with traditional music, dances, and humorous skits that reflect both sorrow and celebration. Sāpāru uniquely blends grief with satire, allowing people to cope with loss while expressing creativity and social commentary. The festival stands out in Bhaktapur for its vibrant parades, spiritual depth, and strong community spirit, making it not just a tribute to the departed but also a celebration of life, continuity, and cultural identity.</p>
