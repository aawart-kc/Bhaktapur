    <p>Biska Jatra is a vibrant and historic festival celebrated mainly in Bhaktapur, Nepal, marking the Nepali New Year in mid-April. Rooted in Newar tradition, the festival is famous for its thrilling chariot processions where massive wooden chariots of deities like Bhairab and Bhadrakali are pulled through narrow city streets in a symbolic tug-of-war between different parts of the city. Another major event is the erection and later pulling down of a giant ceremonial pole known as Yosin Dyo, symbolizing ancient myths of victory over evil. The celebration is full of energy, with traditional music, dances, feasting, and the joyful throwing of colors, especially in nearby Thimi. Biska Jatra is not just a festival but a deeply rooted cultural expression that brings communities together in celebration of renewal, heritage, and spiritual devotion.</p>
