    <p>Tihar, also known as Deepawali, is a vibrant and joyous festival celebrated with great enthusiasm in Nepal, especially among the Newar community. It spans five days and honors various gods, animals, and relationships. A key highlight for the Newars during Tihar is Mha Puja, a special ritual that celebrates the self and the soul. This puja is unique to Newar culture and symbolizes purification and empowerment of oneâ€™s inner spirit for the coming year. Mha Puja involves offering prayers, sacred items, and traditional food to oneself, reinforcing the importance of self-respect and spiritual well-being. Alongside Mha Puja, the Newars decorate their homes with beautiful rangoli (colorful patterns), light oil lamps, and perform other traditional rituals, making Tihar a rich blend of cultural devotion, community bonding, and spiritual renewal.
