During Dashain in Bhaktapur, the presence of the Nawa Durga (also spelled Nava Durga) is especially significant and adds a distinct cultural depth to the festival. The Nawa Durga are a group of nine manifestations of Goddess Durga, worshipped together as protectors of the city and its people. In Bhaktapur, these deities are represented by masked dancers who embody divine spirits through an ancient and sacred ritual performance tradition known as the Nawa Durga Dance.

Although the full Nawa Durga dance cycle begins after Dashain (starting from Maha Puja during Tihar and continuing throughout the year), the Dashain festival marks the official reawakening of these deities. During Dashain, special rituals are performed at Taleju Temple and the Nawa Durga Guthi, where masks, costumes, and sacred items are cleansed and reactivated through powerful Tantric rituals. This period symbolizes the rebirth and empowerment of the gods for the coming year.

The Nawa Durga masks represent deities like Bhadrakali, Mahakali, Barahi, Brahmayani, Indrayani, and others. These deities are believed to protect Bhaktapur from misfortune and disease. The community holds the Nawa Durga tradition with great respect, and only specially chosen and initiated males are allowed to perform as dancers, following strict religious guidelines.

In essence, during Dashain in Bhaktapur, the Nawa Durga play a crucial spiritual and cultural role, bridging the divine and the earthly, and marking the beginning of a sacred cycle that continues to shape Bhaktapurâ€™s identity and heritage throughout the year.</p>
